# SOLUTION 1

### First check if you're using command python ou command python3 ?
### Par exemple il ya une différence entre exécuter 

```
python experiment.py
```
# ET

```
python3 experiment.py
```

## Exemple complet

```
python3 -m venv mountain_car (ici python3 et non python)
mountain_car\Scripts\activate
python nom_du_script.py  (Ici python et non python3)

# SOLUTION 2
-------------------------

- You should use a version like Python 3.11.9, which is a recent version and should be compatible with the OpenAI Gym library. 
- Here's what you can do to resolve the "No module named 'gym'" error:

1. First, try installing Gym using pip:

   ```
   pip install gym
   ```

2. If that doesn't work, you can try specifying the latest version compatible with Python 3.11:

   ```
   pip install gym==0.26.2
   ```

3. If you're still encountering issues, it's possible that pip is not properly configured for your Python installation. In this case, you can try using Python to call pip directly:

   ```
   python -m pip install gym
   ```

4. After installation, verify that Gym is installed correctly by running:

   ```
   python -c "import gym; print(gym.__version__)"
   ```

   This should print the version of Gym if it's installed correctly.

5. If you're using an IDE like PyCharm or VSCode, make sure it's using the correct Python interpreter where you installed Gym.

6. If you're still having trouble, you might want to consider creating a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies:

   ```
   python -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: myenv\Scripts\activate
   pip install gym
   ```

   Then run your script within this virtual environment.

7. If none of the above work, you can try installing from the source:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/openai/gym.git
   cd gym
   pip install -e .
   ```

Remember to restart your Python interpreter or IDE after installation. If you continue to face issues, please provide more details about your system setup or any error messages you receive during the installation process.
